A Python-based program leveraging GNU Radio and software-defined radio (SDR) technology to interfere with and block RFID reader communications. 

NOTE: This script is not going to work by itself if you opened it up inside an IDE, it requires third-party hardware and software component to work as intended.

For the software component, you will need GNU Radio, along with it's required dependencies.

For the hardware component, you will some form of SDR device. HackRF One being an example.
